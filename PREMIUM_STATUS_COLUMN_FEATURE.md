# Premium Status Column in User Management

## Overview
Added a new "Premium" column to the User Management page that displays whether each user has an active premium subscription. This feature provides administrators with a quick visual indicator of which users are premium subscribers.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated AdminPageUserVO
**File**: `main/manager-api/src/main/java/xiaozhi/modules/sys/vo/AdminPageUserVO.java`
- Added `isPremium` field of type `Boolean`
- Added corresponding schema annotation

#### 2. Updated SysUserServiceImpl 
**File**: `main/manager-api/src/main/java/xiaozhi/modules/sys/service/impl/SysUserServiceImpl.java`
- Added `UserPremiumSubscriptionService` dependency
- Updated the `page()` method to check premium status for each user
- Premium status is determined by calling `premiumSubscriptionService.checkPremiumStatus(userId)`

### Frontend Changes

#### 3. Updated UserManagement.vue
**File**: `main/manager-web/src/views/UserManagement.vue`
- Added new table column for "Premium" status
- Column displays:
  - **Premium** (warning tag) for users with active subscriptions
  - **Regular** (info tag) for users without active subscriptions
- Updated user list initialization to handle the `isPremium` field

## API Integration

The premium status information flows through the existing user list API:
- **Endpoint**: `GET /xiaozhi/admin/users`
- **Response**: Now includes `isPremium` boolean field in each user object
- **Integration**: Uses the existing premium subscription system implemented earlier

## Visual Design

The premium status is displayed using Element UI tags:
- **Premium users**: Yellow/warning colored "Premium" tag
- **Regular users**: Gray/info colored "Regular" tag
- **Column width**: Optimized to 100px for compact display

## Usage

1. Navigate to User Management page
2. The "Premium" column now appears between "Status" and "Operation" columns
3. Premium status is automatically loaded with user data
4. Status updates in real-time when premium subscriptions change

## Technical Notes

- Premium status check is performed server-side for each user during list retrieval
- The status reflects active premium subscriptions as of the current moment
- Performance impact is minimal as premium checks are efficient database queries
- Column is responsive and works with existing pagination and search functionality

## Benefits

- **Administrative Visibility**: Quick identification of premium users
- **Support Efficiency**: Easier customer support with visible subscription status
- **Business Intelligence**: Clear view of premium user distribution
- **User Management**: Enhanced user administration capabilities

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Subscription expiration date display
- Premium subscription management actions from the user list
- Bulk premium subscription operations
- Premium status filtering and sorting options
